# Teaching Materials  
Repository by **pfloos** – Teaching resources for quantum chemistry and computational chemistry  

## 📚 Overview  
This repository gathers lecture notes, slides, problem sets, and other teaching materials used in courses and seminars on computational and quantum chemistry.  
Topics include, but are not limited to:  
- Hartree–Fock theory and post-HF methods  
- Density Functional Theory (DFT)  
- Many-Body Perturbation Theory and Green’s functions  
- The Bethe–Salpeter Equation (BSE) and multi-frequency Casida-like equations  
- Hands-on sessions and worked examples  

The aim is to provide a comprehensive, evolving set of resources that can be reused, adapted, or referenced by students, colleagues, and the wider community.

## 🎯 Audience  
These materials are primarily intended for:  
- Master’s and early PhD students in theoretical/computational chemistry or physics  
- Researchers seeking refresher or teaching-support resources  
- Anyone interested in understanding excited-state methods or many-body techniques  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
A high-level overview of the folders in this repository:

```
ANU_lectures/   – Lecture series given at the Australian National University  
DFT/            – Slides, notes, exercises on density functional theory  
GFQC/           – Green’s functions in quantum chemistry  
HF/             – Hartree–Fock theory materials  
postHF/         – Post-HF methods: MP2, CI, CC, etc.  
README.md       – This file  
```

Each folder typically contains:  
- PDF or TeX sources of lecture slides  
- Worked examples and problem sets  
- Optional solutions or instructor notes  

## 🔧 How to Use  
1. Browse the folder corresponding to the topic of interest.  
2. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pfloos/teaching.git
   ```
3. Open the PDFs, TeX files, or notebooks located inside each folder.  
4. Adapt freely for teaching or self-study purposes.  
5. Contributions are welcome — see below.

## 📌 License & Reuse  
Unless otherwise stated in a specific folder, the materials are distributed under the **CC BY 4.0** license.  
You are free to share and adapt the material as long as proper credit is given.
